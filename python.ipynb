        "Ans- Predefined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning\n",
        "      and are used to define the syntax and structure of the language. They cannot be used as identifiers (like variable names) because they are part of the core Python prgramming language. These keywords control the flow of a program and help define operations such as loops, conditions, functions, and classes. For example, if, else, and elif are used for decision-making; for and while for loops; def for\n",

        "Ans Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting one data type into another. This is useful when you need to perform operations that require variables to be in a specific type, such as converting a string to an integer before doing arithmetic. Python provides built-in functions for type casting like int(), float(), str(), and bool().\n",
